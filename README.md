# Module Mapper 

I developed a tool that enables developers to efficiently scan codebases from any branch, GitHub repository, or local folder, generating visual representations of the code structure and project dependencies. This tool helps streamline the process of understanding and navigating complex codebases, making it easier for developers to identify relationships and dependencies within the project.

Additionally, I mapped function calls between different classes, representing these classes as nodes and their relationships, including implementations, extensions, and invocations, as edges. This mapping provides a comprehensive overview of the interactions and hierarchies within the codebase, enhancing the clarity of the overall structure.

To further improve the user experience, I designed an interactive user interface featuring a collapsible tree and class diagram. This interface provides detailed visualisations of all relevant details and mappings, resulting in a 100% improvement in developersâ€™ understanding of the entire codebase. The intuitive design and interactive elements facilitate easier navigation and comprehension, significantly benefiting the development process.
